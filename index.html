            Nikola Tesla, Serbo-Croatian: (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) 
            was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his 
            contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

            <ul>
                <li><b>1856: </b>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire. </li>
                <li><b>1870: </b>Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, 
                    and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.</li>
                <li><b>1884: </b>He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he would become a naturalized citizen.</li>
                <li><b>1885: </b>He worked for a short time at the Edison 
                    Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. </li>
                <li><b>1887: </b>With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up 
                    laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.</li>
                <li><b>1888: </b>His alternating current (AC) induction
                    motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and 
                    became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.</li>
                <li><b>1893: </b>He made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</li>
                <li><b>1910: </b>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.</li>
                <li><b>1943: </b>He died in New York City in January 1943.</li>
